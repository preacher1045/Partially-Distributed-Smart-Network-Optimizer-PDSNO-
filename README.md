# Partially-Distributed-Smart-Network-Optimizer-PDSNO-
PDSNO (Partially Distributed Network Optimizer) is a next-generation network orchestration system designed for ISPs, enterprises, and cloud providers. Unlike traditional centralized NMS/OSS platforms, PDSNO uses a partially distributed controller architecture to deliver:

  Real-time optimization during congestion and failures.
  Programmable automation with YAML/Ansible integration.
  Scalable orchestration across local, regional, and global controllers.

With PDSNO, networks can adapt autonomously, reduce downtime, and operate more efficiently—all while remaining vendor-agnostic and future-proof.
