# 🌍 PDSNO Code of Conduct

We are building an open, intelligent, and distributed network orchestration platform — together.

Our goal is to create a space where **anyone**, regardless of background or experience level, can learn, collaborate, and contribute meaningfully.  
To achieve this, we have a few community standards that everyone is expected to follow.
